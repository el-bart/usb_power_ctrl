installation

1. hardware
having PCB board, FT232 needs to be configured. to do this plug in USB cable and run (as root):
make setup_ft232
note that this target requires ft232r_prog to work. it can be downloaded form http://rtr.ca/ft232r.
next step is compile software. to do this type:
make release
to flash uC with the new software type (as root):
make flash_mcu

2. driver
driver part is written entirely in python. directory "driver" consists of the following elements:
usbpwrctrl.py              - module that can be used to implement own control mechanisms on top.
extension_cort_ctrl.py     - command line interface to the device
extension_cort_ctrl-gui.py - GUI interface to the device.

protocol description.

device is communication via TTL-level RS-232, via USB (FT232 chip). emulated COM port needs to be
set to 9600,8,N,1 in order to work.

each command is ended with new line (LF, CR or any sequence of them). following commands
are available to the user:


hello
sends greeting message. requires device to report. proper response is: "USB power controller vX.Y.Z",
where X,Y,Z are version numbers.

port N {on|off}
changes state of port number N to on or off. response is of the form "port N is S", where
N is a port number and S in "on" or "off" string.

default N {on|off}
sets default (device power-on) state of the port number N to the on or off. this setting is
stored in the nonvolatile memory, thus setups is set until it is changed. response is of
the form "default N is S", where N is a port number and S is "on" or "off".

status {port|default}
returns information about ports being on/off. "port" mode returns actual state, set on ports.
"default" mode returns power-on default state of the ports. response is of the form
"0=A 1=B 2=C 3=D", where numbers are port states and letters are their "on" or "off" states.


in case of an error, "ERROR: D" is returned to the user, where D is error description. note that
"description" part can be empty.

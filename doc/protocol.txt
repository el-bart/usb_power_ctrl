protocol description.

device is communication via TTL-level RS-232, via USB (FT232 chip). emulated COM port needs to be
set to 9600,8,N,1 in order to work.

each command is ended with new line (LF, CR or any sequence of them). following commands
are available to the user:


hello
sends greeting message. requires device to report. proper response is: "USB pwr ctrl vX.Y.Z",
where X,Y,Z are version numbers.

port N {on|off}
changes state of port number N to on or off. response is "OK".

default N {on|off}
sets default (device power-on) state of the port number N to the on or off. this setting is
stored in the nonvolatile memory, thus setups is set until it is changed. response is "OK".

status {current|default}
returns information about ports being on/off. "current" mode returns actual state, currently set.
"default" mode returns power-on default state of the ports. response is of the form
"0=A 1=B 2=C 3=D", where numbers are port states and letters are their "on" or "off" states.


in case of an error, "ERROR" is returned to the user.

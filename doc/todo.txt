* when app is on, while cmd line changes dev state on/off and pressed/not-pressed states can vary.
* add user defined labels to the ports (i.e. names), to make maintainability easier.
* consider automatic selection of the proper serial port.
* consider adding serial port selection window.
* add saving configuration into a file.

* consider adding user-defined name of the device, to be saved in EEPROM, to be able to distinguish between instances of the same device connected to one computer.
* add extra delay after power-on, before enabling devices, to prevent flip-flops on relays in case USB hub is re-initialized few times during post and boot.
